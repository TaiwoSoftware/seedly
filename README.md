## Frontend projects built with NEXTJS.14

This project is a frontend project i got online to boost my nextjs project.

```bash
It is a platform where they give people projects to work on and make you good at frontend development.
So i picked this project as my first project to work on and i'm building myself using nextjs and i'm planning on been a very experience developer currently i'm working with jamorTech as an intern.

### Who is developing this project
I'm Akerele Taiwo David a frontend developer(intern) of jamorTech. Currently 19 years old. I have worked with different companies jamorTech is the current company i'm working with.
I've been writing Reactjs for two years now, due to my research i figured out that there is a library that makes routing in react easy which is Nextjs so i've decided to work with the library and this is the third project i'm working on using NEXTJS.
